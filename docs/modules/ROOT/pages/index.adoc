= docs.dt.in.th

*docs.dt.in.th* builds upon the https://antora.org/[Antora multi-repository documentation site generator] to provide an improved xref:authoring.adoc[authoring workflow] through a custom CLI script, inspired by https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview[Backstageâ€™s TechDocs].

https://github.com/dtinth/docs[The source code is on GitHub.]

== Easy to author with high fidelity previewing

* By running the `dtinth-docs-dev` command, a project documentation can be previewed in isolation through a local development server.
* The development server automatically rebuilds the documentation whenever a file is changed.
* See more information in xref:authoring.adoc[].

.How it works
****
* The https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/[playbook file] for the project is generated on-the-fly, so documentation is previewed in isolation, but with the same setup that would be used to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
****

== Easy to add new project documentations

* New documentation can be added to the site by xref:authoring.adoc#publish[adding a new entry in the Google Sheets spreadsheet], so there is no need to fiddle with playbook files.
