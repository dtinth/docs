= docs.dt.in.th

*docs.dt.in.th* builds upon the https://antora.org/[Antora] multi-repository documentation site generator to provide an improved xref:authoring.adoc[authoring process], inspired by https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview[Backstageâ€™s TechDocs]. https://github.com/dtinth/docs[The source code is on GitHub.]

== Enforced convention

* All project docs must be in the `docs` folder with an `antora.yml` file.
* See more information in xref:authoring.adoc[].

== High-fidelity preview server

* By running the `dtinth-docs-dev` command, a project documentation can be previewed in a local development server.
* The playbook file for the project is generated on-the-fly, so documentation is previewed in isolation, but with the same setup that would be used to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
* The development server automatically rebuilds the documentation whenever a file is changed.
