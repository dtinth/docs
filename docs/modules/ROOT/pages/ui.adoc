= UI development

Antora uses https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/set-up-playbook/#configure-your-sites-ui-bundle[UI bundles] to define the look and feel of a documentation site. They are https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[developed separately] and are built into a ZIP file, to be consumed by Antoraâ€™s https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/how-antora-works/#steps-in-the-default-generator-pipeline[default site generator pipeline].

docs.dt.in.th, like other Antora-based sites, uses its own UI bundle. The source code is located in https://github.com/dtinth/docs-ui[the `dtinth/docs-ui` repository], while the built ZIP file is directly checked in to https://github.com/dtinth/docs[the `dtinth/docs` repository.]

.Why check the UI bundle directly into the `docs` repo?
****
Most Antora projects https://github.com/asciidoctor/docs.asciidoctor.org/blob/d96cba2d4123c3b8b5a07239dcf46ac3ecb327a5/antora-playbook.yml#L65[use a URL] to point to the Antora UI bundle. But checking in the UI bundle directly into the `docs` repo allows the UI to be bundled xref:authoring.adoc[with the `dtinth-docs` command] without requiring https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-docs-ui/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml[a separate release process] which introduces unnecessary overhead.

== Updating UI bundle

Assuming that the `docs` repo and `docs-ui` repos are next to each other:

----
ðŸ“’ docs
  ðŸ“‚ .git
  ðŸ“„ update-ui.sh
  ðŸ“„ ui-bundle-*.zip
  ðŸ“„ â€¦
ðŸ“’ docs-ui
  ðŸ“‚ .git
  ðŸ“„ â€¦
----

Within the `docs` repo, run:

----
./update-ui.sh
----

to update the UI bundle.
