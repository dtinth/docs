== Install the CLI

Install `dtinth/docs` repository directly from GitHub. It installs a CLI tool `dtinth-docs`.

 $ npm i -g dtinth/docs

With the CLI, one can preview how the documentation would look like on the website without having to clone the documentation site repository. The CLI package includes https://antora.org/[Antora] and the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/set-up-playbook/#configure-your-sites-ui-bundle[UI bundle], and automatically generates https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/[the Antora playbook] for editing a project documentation in isolation. This makes it ideal for documenting projects in cloud-based environments such as https://github.com/codespaces[GitHub Codespaces].

⚠️ This CLI tool is not tested on Windows at all. It probably won’t work.

== Initialize a documentation structure for a project

Run this from the repository root:

 $ dtinth-docs init my-project

This command generates the following structure:

 📒 <repo>
   📂 docs
     📄 antora.yml
     📂 modules/ROOT
       📄 nav.adoc
       📂 pages
         📄 index.adoc

== Start the documentation preview server

Run this from the repository root:

 $ dtinth-docs

Then go to http://localhost:9090/[]. As you make changes to the documentation, the server will automatically rebuild the documentation.

TIP: In VS Code, AsciiDoc files can also quickly be previewed using the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc extension]. This gives faster feedback but has lower fidelity.

== Publishing new documentation

. Add a new entry to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kFc9bDizrANULuVSUuHYiZENdPzXZpXvuUWlbZbF_uU/edit#gid=0[the *docs.dt.in.th* spreadsheet on Google Sheets].
. https://github.com/dtinth/docs/actions/workflows/pages.yml[Rebuild the site on GitHub Actions].

== Deploying documentation updates using the CLI

For converience, the deployment workflow action can be triggered from the CLI:

 $ dtinth-docs deploy

After committing your changes, you can push and redeploy the site in one go:

 $ git push && dtinth-docs deploy

NOTE: The https://cli.github.com/[GitHub CLI] must be installed.
